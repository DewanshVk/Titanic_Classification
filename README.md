# Titanic_Classification<br><br>
I created a predictive system to assess a person's chance of surviving the Titanic's sinking for my Titanic Classification project, which I implemented in Jupyter Notebook.<br>
I discovered important determinants of survival from the dataset analysis, such as socioeconomic status, age, and gender.<br>
The dataset was prepared for machine learning algorithms through data preprocessing and feature engineering. I tested the effectiveness of various classification methods, such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, and then I selected the best model. The outcomes emphasized socioeconomic status, age, and gender as important survival predictors, providing insightful information for comprehending the disaster's effects on various passenger groups.
